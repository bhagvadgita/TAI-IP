Introduction
Stock price prediction is a challenging and important problem in the financial industry. This project aims to explore and develop machine learning models for predicting stock prices based on historical data. The prediction can assist investors and traders in making informed decisions by providing insights into potential price trends.

Project Structure
data/: This directory is intended to store the raw and preprocessed data used for training and testing the model.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
src/: Source code for the stock price prediction model.
models/: Trained and serialized model objects for deployment.
utils/: Utility scripts for various tasks such as data preprocessing, model evaluation, etc.
requirements.txt: List of Python packages required to run the project.
Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-price-prediction.git
Install the required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt
Explore the notebooks/ directory to understand the data and model development process.
Use the scripts in the src/ directory to preprocess data and train models.
Data Collection
The data used in this project can be collected from various financial data sources, such as Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, or other reputable financial APIs. Historical stock price data, along with relevant features like trading volume and market indicators, are typically used as inputs for the prediction model.

Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a crucial step in preparing the raw data for training. Common preprocessing steps include handling missing values, scaling features, and creating appropriate input-output pairs for the model. The utils/ directory contains scripts to help with data preprocessing.

Modeling
The src/ directory contains the code for building and training the prediction model. Various machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, LSTM, or more advanced models can be explored.

Training
To train a model, you can use the scripts provided in the src/ directory. These scripts load the preprocessed data, split it into training and testing sets, train the chosen model, and save the trained model to the models/ directory.

Evaluation
The performance of the trained model can be evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and visualizations comparing predicted and actual stock prices. Evaluation scripts can be found in the utils/ directory.

Deployment
Once a satisfactory model is trained and evaluated, it can be deployed for real-world use. This can involve integrating the model into a web application, mobile app, or any other platform that can provide stock price predictions to users.

Further Steps
This project is a starting point for stock price prediction. Further improvements could include:

Hyperparameter tuning to enhance model performance.
Ensembling multiple models for better predictions.
Incorporating news sentiment analysis for more accurate predictions.
Implementing a real-time prediction system.
